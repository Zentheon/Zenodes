# Zenodes
A collection of highly refined node groups for Blender to make your creations easier and more enjoyable.

- Various simple nodes are included to help condense and clean up repetitive operations (**Simple Mix**, **Map to Min**, **True Ping-Pong**)
- Animated nodes, for quickly animating your shaders! (**Frame Number**, **Animate Z**, **Mix Loop**)
- Texture nodes, for creating various masks and shapes wihtout needing a bunch of math nodes! (**Ring Texture**, **Sector Texture**, **Hexagon Grid**)
- And more!

*Most nodes are currently only available in the Shader editor.*
